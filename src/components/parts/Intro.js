      <p id="textOne">SoundCloud is a social network that is used primarily for the distribution of audio tracks.
       If you think about a social network like Pinterest or Instagram as sharing the world in pictures and/or videos, 
       then think of SoundCloud as sharing the world in sounds.Sound designer Alexander Ljung and recording artist Eric
        Wahlforss came up with the idea for SoundCloud in Sweden in 2007, originally as a way for musicians to share their
         music and ideas with each other. But it wasn’t until they incorporated in Germany later that year that SoundCloud
          became what it is today. So what is SoundCloud today? It’s one of the world’s largest online distribution 
          platforms for original music and audio recordings, with over 175 million unique monthly visitors and over 12 hours
           of total audio being uploaded by contributing artists every minute.Sure, listening to music is fun, but why stop 
           there? Speak your mind by adding a comment to an audio track, mark it as a “favorite”, add it to a playlist, or 
           share it over your other social network accounts. You may even be able to download a complimentary copy of the 
           track, so you can play it anywhere, anytime!Unleash your inner D.J. by creating your own playlists of songs. Want 
           a set of music that’s all by your favorite artist? Or maybe you’d like a mix of songs from a certain genre. Or maybe
            there’s some other pattern that you want a specific collection of audio tracks to follow. Share your playlist with 
            other SoundCloud users, or keep it to yourself. It’s totally up to you!
